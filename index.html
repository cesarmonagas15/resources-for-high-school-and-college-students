      and advanced courses are some of the most important ways to help students succeed.
    </p>

    <p> ðŸ’¡ Did you know Latinos only make up about 20% of all AP test takers? And less than half score a 3 or above</p>

    <p>Advanced classes are ways for high school students to challenge themselves academically and prepare for college-level learning. Failure to matriculate in such classes often results in lower college enrollement percentages and higher drop-out rates.</p>

    <p> ðŸ’¡ Did you know that 42% of Latino community college students drop out?</p>

    <p>Matriculation in advanced coursework closely correlates with performance in higher education, and college graduates are more likely to have better salaries and opportunities than their non-college-graduates counterparts. Advanced classes are one of the main ways to ensure that Latino youth are growing intellectually and preparing themselves to succeed in society. If you are a Latino high school student, I would strongly encourage you to take advanced classes! Even if it's only a few classes, challenging yourself with topics that are interesting to you will serve you well when it comes to preparing you for college and professional opportunities.</p>
